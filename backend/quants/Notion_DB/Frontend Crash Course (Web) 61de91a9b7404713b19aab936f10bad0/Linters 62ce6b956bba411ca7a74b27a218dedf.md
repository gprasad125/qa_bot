Linters help clean you code and keep it consistent. They check your code for bad syntax, unused variables, inconsistent syntax, and more. Below are some quick overviews of the main linters you can use for Javascript.

# ESLint

> [https://eslint.org/](https://eslint.org/)

### Key Features

- The old favorite
- Scans your code and outputs issues
- A bunch of customization options

### Description

The normal go-to. Does everything that you expect of a linter and is highly customizable. Usage can range from small syntax warnings to automatic code fixing.

# Prettier

> [https://prettier.io/](https://prettier.io/)
> 

### Key Features

- The new favorite
- Rewrites your code completely into a standardized format
- Little customization

### Description

A solution to the problem where team members can’t agree on what rules to follow. Idea is that instead of agreeing with each other, you compromise by agreeing with whatever Prettier decides. 

Prettier also has a specialty in that, instead of scanning your code like typical linters, it completely rewrites it into its own format. 

# Standard

> [https://standardjs.com/](https://standardjs.com/)
> 

### Key Features

- Opinionated guideline
- Scans your code and outputs issues
- Little customization

### Description

Similar to Prettier where it’s a set of standards meant for everybody on the team to compromise on. However, it acts more like a typical linter instead of rewriting your code.
