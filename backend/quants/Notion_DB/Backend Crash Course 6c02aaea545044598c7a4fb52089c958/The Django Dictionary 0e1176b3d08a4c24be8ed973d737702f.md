# The Django Dictionary

Django uses a lot of jargon, and it can be easy to get lost in the confusion of projects vs apps, models vs views, and what routes are. Here’s a few of the most common terminology you’ll come across in Django development with a simple definition.

# Django General

## Project

> A Django project is a collection of configurations and settings for a specific web application. A project can contain **one or more** Django applications.

## Application
