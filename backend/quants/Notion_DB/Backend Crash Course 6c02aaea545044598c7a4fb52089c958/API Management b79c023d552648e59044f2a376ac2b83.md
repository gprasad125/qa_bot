# API Management

As you develop your APIs, security of the program has to be a high-level priority, especially if you wish to integrate features like:

- Tiered service offerings with pay-as-you-need subscriptions
- Login / Logout system for users to make accounts
- Collection of Personally Identifying Information

API management tools provide you easy ways to test, debug, and find vulnerabilities in your programs. Here, weâ€™ll go through some of the more popular options.
