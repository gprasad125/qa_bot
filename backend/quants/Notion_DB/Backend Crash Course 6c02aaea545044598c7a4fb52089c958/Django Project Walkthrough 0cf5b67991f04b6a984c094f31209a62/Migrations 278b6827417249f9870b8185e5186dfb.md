# Migrations

Migrations in Django are like instructions for how to change the structure of your database. Think of your database like a big spreadsheet that stores information for your website. Just like you can add or remove columns in a spreadsheet, you can also add or remove tables, or fields in your database. 

Migrations are like the **step-by-step instructions on how to make those changes**. They make sure that your database stays in sync with the code that uses it. So, if you make a change to your website's code, you'll also need to make a corresponding change to the migration instructions so that the database can be updated to match.
