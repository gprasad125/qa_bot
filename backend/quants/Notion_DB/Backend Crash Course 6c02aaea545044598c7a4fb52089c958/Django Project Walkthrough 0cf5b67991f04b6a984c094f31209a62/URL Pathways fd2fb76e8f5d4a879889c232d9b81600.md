# URL Pathways

URLs are a way for you to define how your Django project will behave when a user reaches a certain project endpoint. Should a user post some data to your app, you can signal that a specific view should run over the data, handle it, and return some response. 

You can read more about URL behavior [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/http/urls/#url-dispatcher)! Thereâ€™s a lot of cool and interesting ways to use URLs, so make sure to try out different ones.
