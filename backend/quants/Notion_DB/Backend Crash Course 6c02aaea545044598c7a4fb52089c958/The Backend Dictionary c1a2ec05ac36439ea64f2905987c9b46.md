# The Backend Dictionary

A list of common terminologies in backend development with a simple definition. 

---

## APIs

> A set of rules and protocols that enable communication between different pieces of software.
> 
- Example
    
    [APIs](https://www.notion.so/APIs-158298affaed40d384a0ccaceb4015dd)
    

## Server

> A computer program that provides a service to other computers or clients on a network.
> 
- Example
    
    When you type a URL into your web browser and press enter, your computer sends a request to a server that hosts the website, which then sends back the website's data to be displayed in your browser.
    

## Database

> A collection of data organized in a specific manner, allowing for efficient data retrieval, insertion, and modification operations
> 
- Example
    
    A database could be used to store information about users of a social media platform like Instagram, such as their username, email, and password
    

## REST (Representational State Transfer)

> An architectural style for building web services that allows for a standardized way of accessing and manipulating resources.
> 
- Example
    
    Django is a RESTful API, meaning it follows the guidelines set down by REST. Not all APIs are RESTful though, so keep an eye out! You can read about what makes a REST API here. 
    

## CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

> The basic operations that can be performed on data in a database.
> 
- Example
    
    When you use a to-do list app, you are Creating and Updating data values (the tasks you add to your list) from the CRUD operations.
    

## ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

> A technique for converting data between a relational database and an object-oriented programming language.
> 
- Example
    
    When you write code in Python to retrieve data from a relational database, an ORM library can be used to map the database rows to Python objects, making it easier to work with the data in your code.
    

## Session

> A way of storing data that is specific to a single user's interaction with a web application.
> 
- Example
    
    When you log in to a website and navigate to different pages, the website uses a session to keep track of who you are, allowing it to provide a personalized experience and maintain state across multiple requests.
    

## Middleware

> Software that acts as an intermediary between an application and the server, often used to add additional functionality to an application.
> 
- Example
    
    Middleware could be used to add functionality such as authentication and logging to a web application, by processing requests and responses between the application and the server.
    

## Framework

> A set of tools and libraries that provide structure and support for building web applications, making it easier to develop and maintain code.
> 
- Example
    
    Django! Itâ€™s a framework to develop web applications written in Python. Other options include Flask (Python) or Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
